             <p class="blog_text">Recent progress has shown AI’s incredible performance in text and image, but more research is needed for systems to generalise across domains and scales. This will be a crucial step on the path to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) as a transformative tool in our everyday lives.</p>
             <p class="blog_text">As we develop more advanced AI capabilities, we must ensure current methods work as intended and efficiently for the real world. For example, although language models can produce impressive answers, many cannot explain their responses. We introduce a method for using language models to solve multi-step reasoning problems by exploiting their underlying logical structure, providing explanations that can be understood and checked by humans. On the other hand, adversarial attacks are a way of probing the limits of AI models by pushing them to create wrong or harmful outputs. Training on adversarial examples makes models more robust to attacks, but can come at the cost of performance on 'regular' inputs. We show that by adding adapters, we can create models that allow us to control this tradeoff on the fly.</p>
